<center ><p><li><font size="5">A forest is an area of land where various plants and animals grow naturally due to various climatic conditions. 
Depending on the unique characteristics, there are various types of forests like mangrove forests, tropical rainforests, etc. 
Tropical evergreen forests grow in areas where rainfall exceeds 150 centimetres. 
These forests can be found in north-eastern India, some portions of the Western Ghats, the lower Himalayan mountains, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, among other places. 
They do not lose their leaves every year. Wet deciduous forests thrive in areas with annual rainfall ranging from 100 to 200 cm. 
Teak, sakhua, sal, khair, and various other trees grow in these forests naturally, which are economically significant.

Forests are made up of a large number of trees grouped together in one location. 
It helps in the maintenance of oxygen levels since they are a rich source of oxygen that absorbs carbon dioxide exhaled by everyone and helps to sustain the environment. 
Forests aid in the preservation of a pure and clean environment, which we all desire. 
Forests also aid in the maintenance of the ecology and biodiversity, as well as the evaporation and condensation processes. 
Forests are important to both humans and animals for a variety of reasons. 
Humans depend on forests for medicines, food, wood, and other necessities, and all wild creatures rely on them for survival and habitat. 
With todayâ€™s expanding human demands, we have been cutting down a lot of trees, which has resulted in the environment becoming depleted.

Forests are essential for animals as well as for humans. 
Humans are dependent on forests for various reasons, and animals are dependent on forests for their habitat and survival. 
We get various types of fruits, vegetables, medicines, wood, oxygen, etc., from forests. 
Wild animals like lions, tigers, elephants, wolves, foxes, peacocks, giraffes, etc., live in forests, and their whole survival is dependent on forests and forest products. 
Forests bring us rain and maintain the balance in the environment. The ecosystem will be depleted with the depletion of forests. 
Therefore, it is essential to stop cutting down trees and save our forests.
